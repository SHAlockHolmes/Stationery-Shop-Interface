This is built using PHP, HTML and Materilize CSS that are connected to local databases created on Oracle 11g Express Edition. Xampp was used to host the PHP scripts.

## How to connect Oracle 11g Express Edition and PHP

When I worked on this project, it was done on a Windows 10 OS, 64 bit. You may need to go for the more latest versions for the links given below.
Here are some links and tutorials that I used to help me download and connect:
1. Oracle Instant Client - https://www.oracle.com/in/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html
2. PECL Package - https://pecl.php.net/package/oci8/3.0.1/windows
3. Youtbe Video with in-depth steps on how to connect - https://youtu.be/_CNM6ie-PwQ
4. A guide on how you use PHP and Oracle Database - https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/db/oow10/php_db/php_db.htm

The commands to retrive data from the the tables are different from mysql. You can refer to the OCI 8 Manual for these commands: https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.oci8.php
