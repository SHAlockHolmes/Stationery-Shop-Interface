# Stationery-Shop-Interface

This interface consists of Login - Create an account - Edit account - Delete account - Edit Reviews - Delete Reviews.
This is built using PHP, HTML and Materilize CSS that are connected to local databases created on Oracle 11g Express Edition. Xampp was used to host the PHP scripts.

## Connecting Oracle 11g Express Edition and PHP

When I worked on this project, it was done on a Windows 10 OS, 64 bit. You may need to go for the more latest versions for the links given below.
Here are some links and tutorials that I used to help me download and connect:
1. Oracle Instant Client - https://www.oracle.com/in/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html
2. PECL Package - https://pecl.php.net/package/oci8/3.0.1/windows
3. Youtbe Video with in-depth steps on how to connect - https://youtu.be/_CNM6ie-PwQ
4. A guide on how you use PHP and Oracle Database - https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/db/oow10/php_db/php_db.htm

The commands to retrive data from the the tables are different from mysql. You can refer to the OCI 8 Manual for these commands: https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.oci8.php
